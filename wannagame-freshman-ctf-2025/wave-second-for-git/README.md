## Goal

We have to get the flag by using Git cli.

## My Solution

Here is the source, you can download it [here](./Wave-second.zip)

There is the `flag.txt` with this content:

```
VzF7ZzF0aHViXw==
```

It is encoded with base64 algorithm, it is easy to decode it, result is the first part of the flag:

```
W1{g1thub_
```

Now check the source branches with `git branch -r`:

```
origin/HEAD -> origin/main
origin/main
origin/second
```

Let's move to branch `second` to see if there is any change `git checkout second`, the `flag.txt` changed:

```
INGESX3JGVPXK4ZTMZ2TO===
```

It is encoded with base32 algorithm, decode it:

```
CLI_i5_us3fu7
```

Now we got 2 parts:

```
W1{g1thub_CLI_i5_us3fu7
```

Now check the source with `git tag` there is `part3` tag let's show it `git show part3`:

```
tag part3

I use CyberChef to crack this encoding and found `_r1gh7?}`

Flag is: `W1{g1thub_CLI_i5_us3fu7_r1gh7?}`
