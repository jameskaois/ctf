# Crew CTF 2025 Write-ups

This was the first CTF event I joined with my newly created team with my college friends. Though the result wasn't really good, I was still happy because I could learn a lot from this event, especially in web security (the field that I was entrusted by the team).

## Challenges Covered

To be honest, I had just completed 1 web challenge by myself which is the [Love Notes](./love-notes/love-notes.md)

Here are other two challenges that I tried to do during the event but failed. I also write solution about it for educational purposes: [Hate Notes](./hate-notes/hate-notes.md) and [Professor's View](./professor-view/professor-view.md)
