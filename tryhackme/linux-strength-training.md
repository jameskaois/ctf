```

- I copy the value to my hash to a file to local machine:

```bash
$ echo "c05e35377b5a31f428ccda9724a9dfbd0c5d71dccac691228d803c78e2e8da29" >> hashC.txt
$ cat hashC.txt | hash-identifider
```

![Guide image](./screenshots/linux-strength-training-15.png)

- I found it is `sha-256 type`, now I have to download the `ww.mnf` wordlist to my local machine and use `john-the-ripper` to crack the hash:

```bash
$ scp sarah@10.10.87.214:/home/sarah/system\ AB/db/ww.mnf ./
